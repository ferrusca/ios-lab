# Calculator Exercise

Develop an application using Storyboards that simulates a calculator. The application should be capable of displaying the following information:
- Customize the start screen with an image related to a calculator.
- Create a screen that displays a text field simulating the result of operations.
- It should include numbers from 1 to 9 and symbols for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage).
- It should have a button to clear the result (AC) and another to calculate the operation's result (=).

## Extra challenge
Take a look at [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) and use them in your application for the numbers and operations icons.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that the applications run smoothly and display the information correctly on both the iPhone and iPad simulators.

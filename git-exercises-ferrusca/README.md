Exercises to practice the Git commands seen in class

## String Interpolation Exercise
Create a variable in the playground representing Mexico City elevation (2,240 m). Which data type should you use for each one? Give this variable a value and use string interpolation to print the following message to the console "Mexico City has an elevation of 2240 m".

## Arrays
You have an array like the one below
```swift
var myToDoList = ["Take out the trash", "Pay bills", "Cross off finished items"]
```
 
Use the documentation to find a property defined on the Array type that will tell you whether myToDoList
contains any elements. Print `true` in the console if it contains any element and `false` if it doesn't contain any element.

## Sets
Consider the following code that models the cities two people have visited as sets.
```swift
    let myCities: Set = ["Atlanta", "Chicago", "Jacksonville", "New York", "Denver"]
    let yourCities: Set = ["Chicago", "Denver", "Jacksonville"]
```

Find a method on Set that returns a Bool indicating whether myCities contains all the cities contained by yourCities. Print true if the `myCities` Set contains all the cities in `yourCities` and false otherwise
(Hint: This relationship would make myCities a superset of yourCities.)
